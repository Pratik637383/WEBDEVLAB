    <h1 id="lin">LinkedIn</h1>
    <p>
        LinkedIn (/lɪŋktˈɪn/) is an American business and employment-oriented online service that operates via websites and mobile apps. Launched 
        on May 5, 2003,[5] the platform is primarily used for professional networking and career development, and allows job seekers to post their
         CVs and employers to post jobs. From 2015 most of the company's revenue came from selling access to information about its members to 
         recruiters and sales professionals.[6] Since December 2016, it has been a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As of February 2022, 
         LinkedIn has 830+ million registered members from over 200 countries and territories.[4]

        LinkedIn allows members (both workers and employers) to create profiles and connect with each other in an online social network which may
         represent real-world professional relationships. Members can invite anyone (whether an existing member or not) to become a connection
          LinkedIn can also be used to organize offline events, join groups, write articles, publish job postings, post photos and videos, and more.
